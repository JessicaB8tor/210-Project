# Jessica Bator's Personal Project

## An Application for Guitar Players

My idea for this project is to make something that helps
guitarists with music theory. I play guitar and have recently
been trying to delve deeper into theory and *why* songs are
constructed the way they are. I have realized that there are 
many parts of music theory that simply need to be memorized and 
having all this accesible in one program would be ideal.

Some things I want this application to be able to do is:
- Show the notes in each scale (what are the flats and sharps?)
- Display different types of scales(e.g blues, minor pentatonic, major)
- Diagrams showing shapes/notes on the fretboard
- Mark chords/scales as learned
- Save chords as favourites/or to practice
- Picture of the circle of fifths
- Allow a user to listen to notes and chords
- Displays all the places where you can find the same 
note on the fretboard
- Allow users to find backing tracks to play along with 
(possibly sourced from YouTube)
- Have chord diagrams and offer different voicings 
- Allow users to save ideas for chord progressions

This project is of particular interest to me because it is 
something that I, myself would find extremely useful, and I think
others would too. I can also kill two birds with one stone by
expanding my knowledge on theory and programming at the same time!

##User Stories
##Phase 1
- As a user, I want to select chords and add it to a favourite's list
- As a user, I want to select chords and add it to a chord progression idea
- As a user, I want to select a scale and view the notes in it
- As a user, I want to select a chord and view all the notes in it
##Phase 2
- As a user, I want to be able to save "My Chord Progression"
- As a user, I want to be able to load "My Chord Progression" from file
##Phase 4
- Phase 4: Task 2:
 A Type hierarchy
 
The MajorScale and MinorPentatonicScale classes both
extend the abstract Scale class. The abstract method 
getAllNotes() is overrode in both subclasses because 
the minor pentatonic scale includes only 5 notes where as
the major scale includes 7, requiring a slightly different
implementation of the method.
